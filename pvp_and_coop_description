Initiating a PvP battle:
Determine the First Attacker:
Each card (Card1 and Card2) participates in a coin flip simulation, which is represented by generating a 3-bit binary number (e.g., '101'). This is done by flipping a coin three times where heads represent '1' and tails '0'.
Convert the binary numbers to their decimal equivalents.
Compare the decimal values. The card with the higher value wins the coin flip and becomes the attacker for the first round. If there's a tie, repeat the coin flips until there's a clear winner.
Conducting the Battle:
Reset Health:

At the start of the battle, reset both cards' health to their initial values.
Battle Rounds:

Each round consists of the following steps:
The attacker and defender are determined from the initial coin flip.
Both the attacker and defender simulate a coin flip again to generate a new 3-bit binary number for the current round.
Convert these binary numbers to decimal to determine the attack and defense strengths.
Multiply the attacker's roll by the attacker's attack value to get the attack strength.
Multiply the defender's roll by the defender's defense value to get the defense strength.
Apply type modifiers based on the card types (e.g., type1 gains a bonus against type3).
Special Rolls:

If the attacker rolls a '111' (which is '7' in decimal), the defender loses one health point regardless of the defense strength.
If the defender rolls a '111', the attacker loses one health point regardless of the attack strength.
Damage Calculation:

If neither card rolled a '111', compare the attack strength to the defense strength.
If the attack strength is greater than the defense strength, the defender loses one health point.
If the defense strength is equal to or greater than the attack strength, no health is lost by the defender.
Role Switching:

After each round, switch roles so the attacker becomes the defender and vice versa.
Repeat Rounds:

Continue the rounds until one card's health drops to 0.


Battle Rules: Monster Card Showdown

Objective:
Defeat the monster card before it defeats all of your cards. Each player can have up to three cards in play.

Setup:

Each player selects up to three cards, each with specified health, attack, defense, and type.
The monster card is defined with health, attack, defense, and specific weaknesses and strengths against certain types and attributes.
Determining the Starting Player:

Each card and the monster perform a triple coin toss at the start of the battle.
These tosses are translated into a binary number ranging from 0 to 7, where three heads (111) is the highest possible roll.
The highest roll determines the starting attacker. In case of a tie, repeat the coin toss for the tied cards.
Turn Order:

The game alternates between player turns and the monster's turn.
If multiple players are active, they take turns in a clockwise order.
Player's Turn:

On their turn, a player can attack with their active card.
If a player has more than one card, they must choose which card to use for the attack.
The attack's effectiveness is determined by comparing the card's attack value with the monster's defense value, considering any type-related strengths or weaknesses.
Special roll: If the player rolls a 111, the monster incurs an automatic point of damage.
Monster's Turn:

On the monster's turn, it attacks each player's active card.
The monster's attack is compared against the defense of each card, with type modifiers applied.
Special roll: If the monster rolls a 111, each player's active card incurs an automatic point of damage.
Damage Calculation:

If the attacker's roll, multiplied by their attack value, exceeds the defender's roll, multiplied by their defense value, the defender takes a point of damage.
Health points are deducted accordingly.
End of Turn:

After the monster and all players have taken their turns, check the health of all participants.
If the monster's health is 0, the players win.
If all of a player's cards reach 0 health, that player is out of the game.
The game ends when either the monster is defeated or all players' cards are defeated.
Winning the Game:

The players win if the monster's health reaches 0.
The monster wins if it depletes the health of all players' cards.
Modifiers:

Certain types of player cards are stronger or weaker against the monster, as defined by the monster's attributes.
Weaknesses and strengths are applied as fractional modifiers to the monster's attack or defense when battling against specific types.
Gameplay Notes:

Players should strategize which card to use based on the monster's known weaknesses and strengths.
Cooperation and planning are key in a multiplayer setting to effectively use each card's strengths
